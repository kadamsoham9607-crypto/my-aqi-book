# Introduction

Air pollution is a critical environmental issue affecting millions worldwide.  
The **Air Quality Index (AQI)** provides a standardized measure to communicate how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it is forecast to become.

## Why AQI Matters
- Impacts public health, especially respiratory and cardiovascular systems.
- Helps governments and organizations take preventive measures.
- Informs citizens about outdoor activity safety.

This project focuses on analyzing AQI data for selected cities to understand pollution trends and their implications.
