# Conclusion

The AQI analysis demonstrates the pressing issue of air pollution in urban India.

## Key Takeaways
- AQI levels in major cities often exceed safe limits.
- Seasonal variations (e.g., winter smog in Delhi) worsen air quality.
- Public health risks are significant, requiring immediate action.

## Recommendations
- Strengthen pollution control policies.
- Promote sustainable transport and energy solutions.
- Increase public awareness of AQI and its health impacts.

This project provides a foundation for further research and policy development.
